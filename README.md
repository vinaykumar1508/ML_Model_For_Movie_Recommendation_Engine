# ML_Model_For_Movie_Recommendation_Engine

I built a simple model using the movie_dataset.csv dataset for recommending a movie based on the input movie the user has given.
The model calculates the cosine similarity for all the movies on some attributes[ for ex: Genres, director] and then gives the recommendation of movies whose similarity score matches with given
movie.

Dataset: movie_dataset.csv
Execute movie_recommender.py in pyCharm.
